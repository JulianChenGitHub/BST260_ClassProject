In this session, two years (2014 and 2018) data are listed and discussed. For Asia in 2014, Israel had the highest value of 7.28 And the next two highest values came from United Arab emirates (6.90) and Sigapore (6.80).Afghanistan (3.58) and Syria(3.01) had the lowest two values of happiness score. These two countries have been involved with many conflicts/wars for many years. In 2018, Isreal, UAE and Taiwan had the highest values, and Syria, Yemen amd Afghanistan had the lowest values. It is interesting that Combodian jumped from the last three in 2014 (3.82) to the last 13 in 2018 (4.70), which is the lagest transformation in Asia.However, Yeman plummetted from the last four (4.08) to the last two (3.38).

Most African countries had the relative lower happiness countries compared with other continenets. Ecuador had the highest values in both 2014 (5.9) and 2018 (6.0). Togo had the lowest one of 2.84 in 2014 but it jumped to 4.08 in 2018. Central African Republic decreased from 3.68 to 3.08 as the lowest place in 2018. These two sections focused on the data in a static way. The next session formulats the tranfromation through the five years.
